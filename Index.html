        Machine that reads documents with registration of absence, and forwards to a database.
        The point is that the documents are sent to central institutions.
        This works by the local schools with low access to digital tools filling in
        machine-readable documents which are forwarded to central institutions where they will be registered
        and entered in a central database.

        The project can be financed through organizations such as Save children and efforts from local governments and school administrations.
        As this is a solution that should be relatively affordable in operation, the financing is planned to be well achievable.
        Private donors are an important source of contribution for Save the Children, so it is important to inform and engage this group.
        Save the Children already has many valuable partners, project partners, campaign partners and business sponsors who can be good contributors.
        Fundraising / fundraising campaigns to collect financial contributions to the same degree as Save the Children already does.
        Engage primary, secondary schools and sports clubs to organize fundraising activities and shed light on the topic.

        Campaign driven collection on social media.

    As the main focus for our solution, we chose areas and countries with low access to modern infrastructure such as electricity and grid access.
    We wanted to formulate a solution that is relatively cheap to operate and requires minimal training of teachers at the local level to be used.
    The solution must also be universal, ie that there must be no separate absence systems for schools with and without access to relevant infrastructure.</p>
